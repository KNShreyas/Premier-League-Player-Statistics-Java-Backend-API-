# Premier-League-Java-Backend-Project-
Spring Boot, REST API using Java 21 and PostgreSQL to manage and search Premier League player data with advanced filtering and JPA-based CRUD operations.


- Engineered a RESTful API enabling users to search and filter 500+ Premier League 
  player statistics with sub-100ms response times using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL
- Implemented full CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA featuring dynamic multi-parameter 
  filtering by team, position, nationality, and player name
- Designed layered MVC architecture with Controller, Service, and Repository layers 
  utilizing dependency injection and JPA entity mapping
- Built 8+ RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status 
  codes, and JSON serialization using Java 8 Streams API
- Migrated CSV-based player data (15+ statistical attributes) into normalized PostgreSQL 
  database with optimized indexing and transaction management.
